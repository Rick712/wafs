# Frameworks & libraries
## Pro's and Con's
When working with frameworks and libraries, there are a few pro's and con's. Here, I will describe them.
Note: when talking about frameworks and libraries, I will abbieviate them to FoL.

## Pro's
### Efficiency
When working with a particular framework or library, the FoL enables you to perform some tasks in less time than when working with vanilla JS.

### Security
Apperently, when you use a FoL, your website has better securety. I don't know why, but apperently that's just how it works.

### You don't need to reinvent the wheel
FoL are there for a reason. Smart people had a problem, and found a solution for it, and made a FoL. 

## Con's
### Loadtime
When you need to export a FoL, it increases the loadtime of your website, since it needs to load an extra internal or external script.

### Learning
When you are working with a new FoL, it takes time before you know the ins and outs of the FoL.

### Keeping up with the rest
The world is changing rapidly, and so are FoL. It could be that today, your FoL is the best of the best, but tomorrow, it's outdated.

### Limitations
Every FoL has it limitations, and you are bound by the limitations of the FoL.
